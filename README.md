# incremental-decision-tree-learner
It's based on the hoeffding tree i.e. very fast decision tree (VFDT). The paper "Mining High-Speed Data Streams" is published by Domingos &amp; Hulten 2000. 

This is the first version of my python implementation of VFDT. I will try to improve on it. The code is tested on dataset bank.csv which is downloaded from UCI data base.

Another newly published paper extend this modelï¼š "Extremely Fast Decision Tree" by Manapragada, Webb & Salehi 2018. After I'm satisified with VFDT, I will modify it to get this EFDT.
